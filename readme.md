# Day 23: View Function Exercises

Path: Frontend - Austin - Spring 2017  
Practicing view functions and stores.

## Explorer Mode

Complete as many of the five "apps" as possible using the webpack-starter that we used for the chat app.

Make sure everything is working before diving in and writing code. You should see 'Hello World' on the screen after running npm run start.

Take the time to plan out your view functions and write them in app.js before moving them into another file.

Using the store is not a requirement for explorer mode, but it is there for you to use if you wish. Don't let it being there trip you up in the beginning.

Export/Input all of the files you create so you can have multiple views functions, models (constructor functions), but with only the one app.js.

Attempt each of these one at a time, don't stress about how you will get all of them working until you have multiple 'apps' working.

* a) Create a form that saves a blog post to tiny-za-server. The post should have a title and a body. It does not need to display blog posts, just save them. The HTML should exist in a view function.

* b) Create a form for a person. It should have a first name, last name, address, and phone number. It should save the person to tiny-za-server. After submitting the page should display, "Hello PERSON_NAME".

* c) Create a "blog reading app", where you have two columns. A list of blog posts on the side and a place to read the posts in the middle. When you click on a post title, it "opens" that post by placing its contents in the middle column, but does not remove the list from the page.

* e) Create a complete blog CMS from scratch, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

### NOTES
No Copy/Pasted Code ! Even if you have to look at examples for help, do not copy/paste code from class or previous homeworks to complete this assignment.

## WHAT TO SUBMIT
A link to a repository containing at least:
app/scripts/app.js
app/scripts/views/ where your view functions live
In the Notes section, include a link to your project live on the internet
As always, in the Notes section, include your confidence (1-5) and if you are anything below 5, briefly explain why.
